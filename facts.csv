Facts
Henry Ross Perot (/pəˈroʊ/; June 27, 1930 – July 9, 2019) was an American business magnate, billionaire, philanthropist, and politician
He was the founder and chief executive officer of Electronic Data Systems and Perot Systems.
He ran an independent presidential campaign in 1992 and a third-party campaign in 1996, establishing the Reform Party in the latter election. Both campaigns were among the strongest presidential showings by a third party or independent candidate in US history.
Born in Texarkana, Texas, Perot became a salesman for IBM after serving in the United States Navy.
In 1962, he founded Electronic Data Systems, a data processing service company.
Perot established Perot Systems in 1988 and was an angel investor for NeXT, a computer company founded by Steve Jobs after he left Apple.
Perot also became heavily involved in the Vietnam War POW/MIA issue, arguing that hundreds of American servicemen were left behind in Southeast Asia after the Vietnam War.
During President George H. W. Bush's tenure, Perot became increasingly active in politics and strongly opposed the Gulf War and ratification of the North American Free Trade Agreement.
In 1992, Perot announced his intention to run for president and advocated a balanced budget, an end to the outsourcing of jobs, and the enactment of electronic direct democracy.
A June 1992 Gallup poll showed Perot leading a three-way race against President Bush and presumptive Democratic nominee Bill Clinton.
Perot chose Admiral James Stockdale as his running mate and appeared in the 1992 debates with Bush and Clinton.
In the election, Perot received 18.9% of the popular vote, but did not win any electoral votes.
Perot ran for president again in 1996, establishing the Reform Party as a vehicle for his campaign. He won 8.4 percent of the popular vote against President Clinton and Republican nominee Bob Dole.
In 2009, Dell acquired Perot Systems for $3.9 billion.
According to Forbes, Perot was the 167th richest person in the United States in 2016.
Perot was born in Texarkana, Texas, the son of Lula May (née Ray) and Gabriel Ross Perot, a commodity broker specializing in cotton contracts.
He attended a private school called Patty Hill.
He graduated from Texas High School in Texarkana in 1947.
One of Perot's childhood friends was Hayes McClerkin, who later became the Speaker of the Arkansas House of Representatives and a prominent lawyer in Texarkana, Arkansas.
While in his teens, Perot changed his middle name from Ray to Ross to honor his father.
Perot had an older brother, Gabriel Ross Jr., who died at an early age.
Perot joined the Boy Scouts of America and made Eagle Scout in 1942, after 13 months in the program. He was a recipient of the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award.
From 1947 to 1949, he attended Texarkana Junior College, then entered the United States Naval Academy in 1949 and helped establish its honor system.
Perot said his appointment notice to the academy—sent by telegram—was sent by W. Lee "Pappy" O'Daniel, Texas's 34th governor and former senator.
Perot married Margot Birmingham of Greensburg, Pennsylvania, in 1956.
After he left the Navy in 1957, Perot became a salesman for IBM.
He left IBM in 1962 to found Electronic Data Systems (EDS) in Dallas, Texas, and courted large corporations for his data processing services. Perot was refused 77 times before he was given his first contract.
EDS received lucrative contracts from the US government in the 1960s, computerizing Medicare records.
EDS went public in 1968 and the stock price rose from $16 a share to $160 within days.
Fortune called Perot the "fastest, richest Texan" in a 1968 cover story.
In 1984, General Motors bought controlling interest in EDS for $2.4 billion.
In 1974, Perot gained some press attention for being "the biggest individual loser ever on the New York Stock Exchange" when his EDS shares dropped $450 million in value in a single day in April 1970.
Just prior to the 1979 Iranian Revolution, the government of Iran imprisoned two EDS employees in a contract dispute. Perot organized and sponsored their rescue. The rescue team was led by retired United States Army Special Forces Colonel Arthur D. "Bull" Simons. When the team was unable to find a way to extract the two prisoners, they decided to wait for a mob of pro-Ayatollah revolutionaries to storm the jail and free all 10,000 inmates, many of whom were political prisoners. The two prisoners then connected with the rescue team, and the team spirited them out of Iran via a risky border crossing into Turkey.
In 1984, Perot's Perot Foundation bought a very early copy of Magna Carta, one of only a few to leave the United Kingdom.
After Steve Jobs lost the original power struggle at Apple and left to found NeXT, his angel investor was Perot, who invested over $20 million.  Perot believed in Jobs and did not want to miss out, as he had with his chance to invest in Bill Gates's fledgling Microsoft.
In 1988, he founded Perot Systems Corporation in Plano, Texas. His son, Ross Perot, Jr., eventually succeeded him as CEO.
In September 2009, Perot Systems was acquired by Dell for $3.9 billion.
After a visit to Laos in 1969, made at the request of the White House, in which he met with senior North Vietnamese officials, Perot became heavily involved in the Vietnam War POW/MIA issue. He believed that hundreds of American servicemen were left behind in Southeast Asia at the end of the US involvement in the war, and that government officials were covering up POW/MIA investigations to avoid revealing a drug-smuggling operation used to finance a secret war in Laos.
In 1990, Perot reached agreement with Vietnam's Foreign Ministry to become its business agent in the event that diplomatic relations were normalized.
Perot did not support President George H. W. Bush, and vigorously opposed the United States' involvement in the 1990–1991 Persian Gulf War. He unsuccessfully urged Senators to vote against the war resolution, and began to consider his own presidential run.
On February 20, 1992, Perot appeared on CNN's Larry King Live and announced his intention to run as an independent if his supporters could get his name on the ballot in all 50 states.
With such declared policies as balancing the federal budget, opposition to gun control, ending the outsourcing of jobs and enacting electronic direct democracy via "electronic town halls," he became a potential candidate and soon polled roughly even with the two major party candidates.
Perot's candidacy received increasing media attention when the competitive phase of the primary season ended for the two major parties. With the insurgent candidacies of Republican Pat Buchanan and Democrat Jerry Brown winding down, Perot was the natural beneficiary of populist resentment toward establishment politicians.
On May 25, 1992, he was featured on the cover of Time with the title "Waiting for Perot", an allusion to Samuel Beckett's play Waiting for Godot.
Several months before the Democratic and Republican conventions, Perot filled the vacuum of election news, as his supporters began petition drives to get him on the ballot in all 50 states. This sense of momentum was reinforced when Perot employed two savvy campaign managers in Democrat Hamilton Jordan and Republican Ed Rollins.
In July, while Perot was pondering whether to run for office, his supporters established a campaign organization United We Stand America. Perot was late in making formal policy proposals, but most of what he did call for was intended to reduce the deficit, such as a fuel tax increase and cutbacks to Social Security.
In September, he qualified for all 50 state ballots. On October 1, he announced his intention to re-enter the presidential race.
He campaigned in 16 states and spent an estimated $12.3 million of his own money.
Perot employed the innovative strategy of purchasing half-hour blocks of time on major networks for infomercial-type campaign advertisements; this advertising garnered more viewership than many sitcoms, with one Friday night program in October attracting 10.5 million viewers.
At one point in June, Perot led the polls with 39% (versus 31% for Bush and 25% for Clinton).
Just prior to the debates, Perot received 7–9% support in nationwide polls.
The debates likely played a significant role in his ultimate receipt of 19% of the popular vote. Although his answers during the debates were often general, Frank Newport of Gallup concluded that Perot "convincingly won the first debate, coming in significantly ahead of both the Democratic challenger Clinton and incumbent President George H.W. Bush".
In the debate, he remarked: Keep in mind our Constitution predates the Industrial Revolution. Our founders did not know about electricity, the train, telephones, radio, television, automobiles, airplanes, rockets, nuclear weapons, satellites, or space exploration. There's a lot they didn't know about. It would be interesting to see what kind of document they'd draft today. Just keeping it frozen in time won't hack it.
Perot denounced Congress for its inaction in his speech at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C., on March 18, 1992; he said: This city has become a town filled with sound bites, shell games, handlers, media stuntmen who posture, create images, talk, shoot off Roman candles, but don't ever accomplish anything. We need deeds, not words, in this city.
In the 1992 election, he received 18.9% of the popular vote, about 19,741,065 votes, but no electoral college votes, making him the most successful third-party presidential candidate in terms of the popular vote since Theodore Roosevelt in the 1912 election.
Unlike Perot, however, some other third party candidates since Roosevelt have won electoral college votes. (Robert La Follette had 13 in 1924, Strom Thurmond had 39 in 1948, George Wallace had 46 in 1968 and John Hospers won one in 1972, albeit from a faithless elector.
A detailed analysis of voting demographics revealed that Perot's support drew heavily from across the political spectrum, with 20% of his votes coming from self-described liberals, 27% from self-described conservatives, and 53% coming from self-described moderates.
Economically, however, the majority of Perot voters (57%) were middle class, earning between $15,000 and $49,000 annually, with the bulk of the remainder drawing from the upper middle class (29% earning more than $50,000 annually).
Exit polls also showed that Ross Perot drew 38% of his vote from Bush, and 38% of his vote from Clinton.
Despite widespread claims that Perot acted as a "spoiler," there is little reason to think he affected the outcome of the 1992 Presidential election.
Based on his performance in the popular vote in 1992, Perot was entitled to receive federal election funding for 1996.
Perot remained in the public eye after the election and championed opposition to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), urging voters to listen for the "giant sucking sound" of American jobs heading south to Mexico should NAFTA be ratified.
Perot tried to keep his movement alive through the mid-1990s, continuing to speak about the increasing national debt.
He was a prominent campaigner against the NAFTA, and even debated with then Vice President Al Gore on the issue on Larry King Live. Perot's behavior during the debate was a source of mirth thereafter, including his repeated pleas to "let me finish" in his southern drawl. The debate was seen by many as effectively ending Perot's political career.
In 1995, he founded the Reform Party and won their presidential nomination for the 1996 United States presidential election. His vice presidential running mate was Pat Choate. Because of the ballot access laws, he had to run as an Independent on many state ballots.
Perot received 8% of the popular vote in 1996, lower than in the 1992 race, but still an unusually successful third-party showing by US standards. He spent much less of his own money in this race than he had four years before, and also allowed other people to contribute to his campaign, unlike his prior race.
In the 2000 presidential election, Perot refused to become openly involved with the internal Reform Party dispute between supporters of Pat Buchanan and John Hagelin.
He appeared on Larry King Live four days before the election and endorsed George W. Bush for president.
Despite his earlier opposition to NAFTA, Perot remained largely silent about expanded use of guest-worker visas in the United States, with Buchanan supporters attributing this silence to his corporate reliance on foreign workers.
In 2005, Perot was asked to testify before the Texas Legislature in support of proposals to extend technology to students, including making laptops available to them. He supported changing the process of buying textbooks by making e-books available and by allowing schools to buy books at the local level instead of going through the state.
In an April 2005 interview, Perot expressed concern about the state of progress on issues that he had raised in his presidential runs.
In January 2008, Perot publicly came out against Republican candidate John McCain and endorsed Mitt Romney for president.
In 2012, Perot endorsed Romney for president again.
Perot did not give any endorsements for the 2016 election.
During Perot's political campaigns, he spoke less on social issues and instead focused on the fiscal issues of the time.
Perot did not fit the typical stereotype of a conservative southerner; his views were seen as liberal and usually focused on his economic policy to keep support during his campaigns and gain support from both Democratic and Republican voters from his home state of Texas.
Perot was pro-choice, supported gay rights, stricter gun controls such as an assault rifle ban and increased research in AIDS.
From 1992, Perot was a pro-choice activist, and a strong supporter of Planned Parenthood. He stated poorer women in particular should have access to abortions via federal funding.
Perot believed taxes should be increased on the wealthy, while spending should be cut to help pay off the national debt.
Perot also believed the capital gains tax should be increased, while giving tax breaks to those starting new businesses.
We cut the capital gains tax rate from a maximum rate of 35% to a maximum rate that got as low as 20% during the 1980s. Who got the benefit? The rich did, of course, because that's who owns most of the capital assets.
In his 1993 book Not For Sale at Any Price, Perot expressed support for giving tax cuts for small and medium-sized enterprises, as opposed to larger corporations.
Additionally, Perot supported a balanced budget amendment, stating, "spending should not exceed revenue for 27 consecutive years."
On trade, Perot stated that there was a trade deficit between Mexico and the United States and a loss of manufacturing jobs which he believed was caused by NAFTA.
His position on free trade and NAFTA became his defining campaign principles of both the 1992 and 1996 presidential elections.
Perot argued: "We have got to stop sending jobs overseas. It's pretty simple: If you're paying $12, $13, $14 an hour for factory workers and you can move your factory south of the border, pay a dollar an hour for labor, ... have no health care—that's the most expensive single element in making a car—have no environmental controls, no pollution controls and no retirement, and you don't care about anything but making money, there will be a giant sucking sound going south."
Perot and his wife Margot (née Birmingham) had five children (Ross Jr., Nancy, Suzanne, Carolyn, and Katherine).
With an estimated net worth of about US$4.1 billion in 2019, he was ranked by Forbes as the 167th-richest person in the United States.
Perot died on July 9, 2019, at the age of 89 in Dallas, Texas, from leukemia.
